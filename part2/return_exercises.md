# Return Value Exercises

0. Create a new file called `return_exercises.rb`

0. Write a method called `#times_three_and_plus_five` that accepts an integer, n, as an argument. Your method should multiply n by 3, and then add 5. For example, `times_three_and_plus_five(4)` should return 17. Do this using an **explicit return**.

0. Change your `#times_three_and_plus_five` method to instead use an **implicit** return.

0. Open pry and play around with the `#even?` and `#odd?` methods for integers. We'll use these in the next problem.

  ```ruby
    5.odd? # ==> true
    5.even? # ==> false
  ```

0. Write a method called `#even_or_odd`, that accepts an integer as an argument. Your method should return the string "even" if the integer is even, and return "odd" if the integer is odd. Follow the pattern used in the `#is_billy?` method from the reading. Also, use the `#even?` and `#odd?` methods we explored in the previous step.
