# Scripts and Methods Solutions

\#2. Write a method `#print_thrice`, that accepts a string as an argument. It should `puts` that string 3 times.

  ```ruby
  def print_thrice(string)
    puts(string)
    puts(string)
    puts(string)
  end
  ```

\#3. Write a method, `#print_thrice_thrice`, that also accepts a string as an argument. It should call `print_thrice` with that string three times (for 9 total prints).

  ```ruby
  def print_thrice_thrice(string)
    print_thrice(string)
    print_thrice(string)
    print_thrice(string)
  end
  ```

\#4. Write a method, `#add_multiply_subtract`, that accepts two integers as arguments. Your method should do the following:
  * add the two numbers
  * multiply the two numbers
  * subtract the sum from the product
  * puts the result

You should create 3 variables (sum, product, difference) to help keep your code neat and clean!

  ```ruby
  def add_multiply_subtract(m, n)
    sum = m + n
    product = m * n
    difference = product - sum
    puts difference
  end
  ```
