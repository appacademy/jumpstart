# Loops

## Introduction

A common idea in computer science is that humans are good at performing tasks that are hard to describe but easy to accomplish, such as: "make a sandwich".

Computers, on the other hand, are good at performing tasks that are easy to describe, but hard to accomplish, such as: "write 'oo-la-la' 1000 times". That task might take you a while.. but introduce 5 lines of code:

```ruby
i = 1
while i <= 1000
  puts "oo-la-la"
  i += 1
end
```

And you're done! Copy and paste the above loop into pry. Remember to use the `clear` command to clear your terminal afterwards!

## The `while` loop

The `while` loop tells your computer to do something over and over again, but only *while* some condition is true. In the example above, we tell the computer to do something *while* `i <= 1000`. Meaning, as soon as `i` reaches 1001, we stop.

This might beg the question, what if `i` never reaches 1001? Or to phrase the question differently, what if our condition never becomes false?

```ruby
while 1 == 1
  # ...
end
```

The above loop will run **forever**, until the end of time. This means we have to design our loops carefully!

**All while loops should perform some operation that trends towards a falsey condition.** In our first example, we increment `i` by one with each iteration.

## The `until` loop

The `until` loop is to the `while` loop, what `unless` is to `if`. In other words, `until` is the same as `while !(..)`. We can re-write the first example using an `until` loop like so:

```ruby
i = 1
until !(i <= 1000)
  puts "oo-la-la"
  i += 1
end
```

or...

```ruby
i = 1
until i > 1000
  puts "oo-la-la"
  i += 1
end
```

All three approaches are perfectly valid! You should use whichever makes more lexical sense -- whichever reads more like natural English.

## `break` and `next`

`break` and `next` are two keywords that we can use inside of any ruby loop. So far, we only know `while` and `until`, but we'll learn more later.

`break` allows us to exit a loop early, similar to how `return` exits a method early. `next` will tell our loop to jump to the next iteration.

We could re-write our first `while` loop like so:

```ruby
i = 1
while true
  break if i > 1000
  puts "oo-la-la"
  i += 1
end
```

The `next` command is good for skipping over irrelevant iterations. Let's say we have the following problem statement:

  *Define a method, sum_odds(n), that accepts an integer, n, as an argument. Sum all the odd integers between 0 and n.*

We can use a while loop to iterate over all the numbers between 0 and n. We can then use `next` to skip over all the even numbers.

```ruby
def sum_odds(n)
  i = 0
  sum = 0

  while i <= n
    i += 1
    next if i.even?
    sum += i
  end

  sum
end
```
