# Conditionals

## Introduction

Conditionals are how we tell computers "if this.. do that! otherwise.. do this!" There a are a couple key words to learn:
  * `if`
  * `else`
  * `elsif`
  * `unless`

Let's learn how to use these tools to create powerful code! **This is where things get fun :)**


## `if`

The syntax for using `if` blocks in ruby looks like this:

```ruby
if _______ #this thing is truthy
  # do something!
end
```

For example, we could say:

```ruby
if 1 == 1
  puts "yup! 1 equals 1"
end
```

`if` statements become even more powerful when we write methods that can do different things.

```ruby
def exclaim_even_or_odd(n)
  if n.odd?
    return "this is odd!"
  end
  "this is even"
end
```

## `else`

The `else` statement is an *optional* add-on to the `if` statement. Let's say we wanted to change our method above to `puts` rather than `return`...

```ruby
def exclaim_even_or_odd(n)
  if n.odd?
    puts "this is odd!"
  end
  puts "this is even"
end
```

This won't work as we intended, because "this is even" will always be printed! We could use an `if .. else` statement to accomplish this..

```ruby
def exclaim_even_or_odd(n)
  if n.odd?
    puts "this is odd!"
  else
    puts "this is even"
  end
end
```

## `elsif`

In ruby, we have the ability to chain an infinite number of `if` statements together using `elsif`. For example..

```ruby
def do_i_know_you?(name)
  if name == "Pierre"
    return "I know this guy!"

  elsif name == "Kofi"
    return "We are friends!"

  elsif name == "Fatima"
    return "We go wayyy back"

  else
    return "Sorry, I don't know you!"
  end
end
```

## `unless`

Finally, ruby gives us one more conditional to use: `unless`. `unless` is semantically identical to `if !`..

```ruby
unless x # ==> if !x
if x     # ==> unless !x
```

We can make `if !` statements read more like English if we refactor them to use `unless`. For example:

```ruby
if !(x == 5)
  # do something...
end

unless x == 5
  # do something
end
```

Both conditional statements above are perfectly valid! But read them both aloud and think about which seems more intuitive to work with.

## One-liners

In ruby , we can write *short* conditionals on one line using `if` and `unless`.

```ruby
if x == 10
  puts "yay 10!"
end
```

Can be refactored into...

```ruby
puts "yay 10!" if x == 10
```

We can make one-liner `unless` statements too:

```ruby
puts "yay not 10!" unless x == 10
```

This is **very** common practice in ruby. Generally, if you can make the conditional fit on one line, put it on one line. Note that you **cannot** use one-liners when writing `if .. else` statements.
