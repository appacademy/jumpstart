# Debugger setup

We're going to be using the debugger a lot in your course.  We'd like you to install it ahead of time.  Here's how.

## Instructions

1. Open your Cloud9 workspace.
2. In your console, run `gem install byebug`.
3. Make a new file and `require 'byebug'` at the top.
4. Test out that you can drop the word `byebug` into a sample function and that you can print out the argument.  Make sure you return something from the function.
5. Make sure you've saved your file.

Note: If you are using Terminal on a Mac instead of Cloud9, you need to set up [ruby version control](./rbenv_setup.md) before installing any gems. 

If you're confused, see below:
