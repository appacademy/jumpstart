# Ruby Setup

## Make a Cloud9 account

Start by making a [Cloud9 account][c9]. Cloud9 will ask for your credit card info, but they won't charge you unless you specifically ask to upgrade (we'll vouch for them!) If you'd prefer not to disclose your credit card info, feel free to use [CodeAnywhere][ca] instead.

Once you have an account on Cloud9, follow the following steps:

![Setup Cloud9](./setup-cloud9.gif)

0. Create a new workspace; call it 'jumpstart_workspace'
0. Choose 'custom' when asked to chose a template

## Test that it works for you

Test your environment by following these steps:

![Hello World Cloud9](./hello-world-cloud9.gif)

0. Create a new file called `hello_world.rb`; put it in the 'jumpstart_workspace' folder
0. write the line `puts "Hello World!"` in `hello_world.rb`
0. Open a new terminal and run `ruby hello_world.rb` - You should see "Hello World!"
