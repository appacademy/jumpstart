# Assessment 1 - Practice Assessments

You should take these practice assessments in a timed setting! They are 1 hour in length. Remember, all assessments **are strictly closed-notes**. That means:

  * no notes
  * no Google
  * no ruby-docs

Scratch paper is allowed - and encouraged! Please feel free to **define all the helper methods you need!** You should know your score at the end of the assessment; it is based on the number of print statements that print "true".
