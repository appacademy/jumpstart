# App Academy JumpStart

Welcome to App Academy JumpStart! We're excited to work with you in the upcoming weeks. At JumpStart, you'll have the opportunity to work through our curriculum with App Academy staff present to guide your learning. You'll also meet and work with other students at the same level as you!

At JumpStart, we'll provide you with bonus supplementary material to help you solidify what you're learning:
  * Live coding demos
  * Pair programming exercises
  * Nightly homework

Check out our [Logistics Document][logistics]. **Read this thoroughly!**

JumpStart's curriculum is split into two steps:
  * [Step 1 Curriculum][step-1]
  * [Step 2 Curriculum][step-2]

You **must complete both steps** to be eligible for admission to App Academy. Each step will take about 24 hours of work to complete. Step 1 is for those completely new to programming, while step 2 is for those that have already learned ruby fundamentals. You have 2 options for completing these steps:

  **Option 1**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do the first step *at home*, before JumpStart, and then do the second step once you're here (recommended).

  <!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  **Option 2**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do the first step *during JumpStart*, and then return for a *second round of JumpStart* (for a total of 4 weeks) to complete the second step. This option may be for you if you are brand new to coding or are struggling with the first step at home. -->

  **Option 2**
  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Do the first step *during JumpStart*, and then do the second step at home. You will have to complete a Skype interview after finishing the second step. This option may be for you if you are brand new to coding or are struggling with the first step at home.

If you've already completed an at-home coding challenge or technical interview, you are likely beyond the material of step 1. You do not need to complete it.
