# Terminal Exercises

0. Practice using `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls` to explore your computer's directory structure. Enter `cd ..` until you go all the way down to the root directory, `/`. Look at the various directories that make up a Linux and OSX computer system. Don't worry, you're not going to break anything.

0. Navigate to the directory of your desktop (if you're using your mac) or your workspace (if your using CLoud9). This is usually `~/Desktop` or `~/workspace`, respectively.

0. Run the last three commands you executed without typing them manually! Use the up arrow and see what happens.

0. Practice using the tab-autocompletion. Type `cd ~/Desk` or `cd ~/work` and then hit the tab key. See it autocomplete!? This is a huge time saver.
